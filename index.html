      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p1>
        Hi, I'm Jack, a London-based designer and video editor who can
        work independently, as well as part of a team. I'm currently
        learning software development. I have an organised and
        proactive approach to work.
      </p1>
    </div>
    <div class="page" id="why-code">
      <h2>Why code?</h2>
      <p2>
        Born in 1996, I grew up on the internet and was just old enough
        to appreciate the seismic shift to mobile touchscreens. In the
        "There's an app for that" boom that followed, I had an idea for
        an app that wakes you up when you're nearly at your bus
        stop/train station, and set about trying to learn how to use
        Xcode. I quickly realised I couldn't build an app in the space
        of a school summer holiday and gave up. I decided that coding
        was just too difficult for me.
      </p2>
      <p2>
        In the time since, I've continued to love using computers -
        whether that be for graphic design or video editing, and more
        recently, for setting up a small media server. Being introduced
        to Plex and Jellyfin opened up a lot of doors in terms of what
        technology can do. I was suddenly free of the gated and
        restricted access to the internet via social media, Amazon and
        Netflix. This discovery made me excited to find out more about
        open source software on GitHub.
      </p2>
      <p2>
        Website design and the growth of the internet has always been
        an interest of mine but stumbling upon
        <a href="http://www--arc.com/" target="_blank">
          Web Design as Architecture</a
        >
        proved a significant inspiration in me wanting to learn to
        code. In my graphic design work, I enjoyed using CMS like
        Squarespace but - on top of increasingly exorbitant monthly
        fees - I always felt like this process was missing
        adaptability. On top of this, I knew these companies were
        complicit in centralising access to the internet. If we want to
        build an accessible and decolonised internet, we are going to
        have to build it ourselves. Just as in the poster,
        <a
          href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dlh_mOmWsAIN9mo.jpg"
          target="_blank"
        >
          "Everything is architecture, everyone an architect",</a
        >
        open source provides access to these tools for everyone who
        needs it. This accessibility is easier to reach than it seems.
        For example, keeping track of my changes on GitHub provides
        other people resources to learn in the future, while my
        <a href="https://github.com/jones58" target="_blank"
          >profile</a
        >
        also links to my
        <a
          href="https://github.com/jones58/Learning-Resources"
          target="_blank"
          >favourite learning resources</a
        >
        and my
        <a
          href="https://github.com/jones58/my-coding-progress/"
          target="_blank"
          >coding progress</a
        >, to provide a loose guide, or inspire other learners.
